        <img src="IMG_3026.JPEG" alt="Image of me" width = 270>
        <p>My name is Zac Volmer and I am from Richland, Washington. I am 19 years old and this is my first semester as a Computer Science major at BYUI.</p>
        <p>Some of my hobbies are listening to and writing music, playing guitar in a band, rock climbing, and playing video games.</p>
        <p>Learning about careers in Web Design will help me both in my future career, and my personal life. I hope to better understand how websites work and at least at a basic level how to design and make webpages.</p>
        <p>I have been a member of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints for my entire life. One of my favorite scriptures is 1 John 4:11 which says "Beloved, if God so loved us, we ought also to love one another."</p>
