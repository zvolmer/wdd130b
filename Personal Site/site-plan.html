        Content
      </h2>
      <h3>Home page</h3>
      <p>
        The home page will include a lot of important information for my site. The main things included on the home page will be links to where people can listen to our music on streaming services, announcements on future releases and any music we have coming out, information on any concerts or events we have coming up, and a short biography of the band and what type of music we make. The home page will also include multiple images including pictures of us, images of posters advertising concerts and events, and images of album covers of currrent and future releases. The home page will also include links to the Contact Us and Merch pages. This site will answer many questions for the users such as where to listen to our music, what type of music we make, how they can contact us for booking or any other reason, when and where we have upcoming concerts and events, when and where we are releasing new music, what CDs and merch we have available, and where people can contact us to order CDs and merch. People will use this site instead of any others because there aren't any other websites made that include all of this information on one single website, so my site is the only option.

        Page 2 will include our contact information. This is so that people can contact us for booking, ordering merch, and any other reason they may want to contact us. This page will include our email address, phone number, and links to all of our social media pages.
