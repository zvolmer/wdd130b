            <h1>Biography:</h1>
            <p>Flightless is the #1 band to never leave the ground.

                Flightless was formed in Richland, WA in 2020 by Zac Volmer (guitar) and Michael Perry (bass). After jamming, gigging, and writing music with many local musicians, the first official lineup of Flightless was solidified with Weston Brady (guitar), Keaton Garrity (vocals), and Quinton Perry (drums) all joining the band.
                
                As Flightless began to write more music, they developed their unique sound combining influences from punk, rock, grunge, metal, emo and indie music. After recording multiple demos on their own, Flightless began recording at Thunderdome Studios in May of 2023 while all of the members were still in high school. Their first single, Whatcha' Doin released on August 23rd, 2023, followed by Whistle on September 19th, 2023, Confusion on December 9th, 2023, and finally their debut self-titled album Flightless on March 1st, 2024.
                
                Before the album had even released, Weston and Quinton both left the band to go on 2-year missions. Initially joining to play guitar, Isaac Shaklee (Moocher, Wonderbad) took over as the new drummer.
                
                With this new lineup, Flightless continued gigging and writing new music. Very shortly after the release of their first album, they were back in the studio recording new music and their 5-song Acoustic EP is set to release on December 27th, 2024.
                
                Flightless is currently working on writing and recording a new future project.</p>
